Introduction:
the project aims to achieve high quality audio classification using image classifcation techniques 
it basically involves converting the audio files into log mel spectrograms and then using various models like resNET or VGGnet and also normal CNNS to classify them 
we use several datasets for this purposes 
starting of with the smaller urbansound8k dataset followed by ESC-50 and speech activity detection dataset
we try out many trending areas such as few shot classification , speech audio detection and speaker diarization
